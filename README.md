# Airbnb Seattle 
A simple analysis of Airbnb Seattle hosts, to assist in the elaboration of the article on the medium https://enzo-santanarocha.medium.com/se-hospedando-com-o-python-2ea7208dfd7a- done by Enzo Rocha. On the jupyter notebook, I prepared the base and generated graphics to draw some questioning conclusions that emerged during the analysis.

At first I imported the necessary libraries:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn

With that, I imported the bases. With the imported bases, I was able to look and familiarize myself with the information offered;
At first, I only used the base of listings, but there are others, such as calendar and reviews.

1st question: What has been the growth of hosts since the foundation of the application (2008)?

2nd question: How are the types of properties distributed across regions?

3 Â° How important is communication for the average score?
